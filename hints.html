    <p class="final1">- Save Your Game as often as possible</p>

<p class="final2">- Make Good Parties, For Example, Two Red Mages and One Black Mage is a Great Trio that can cast Powerful Spells on Anybody.</p>

<p class="final3">- Once you have enough Money, Stock up on Potions and Antidotes, poisons are very dangerous and with Potions and Antidotes you won't have to worry about that.</p>

<p class="final4">- Make sure to Pace yourself, so that you can successfully return to a Town after raiding a Dungeon</p>

<p class="final5">- If you don't know where to go, explore the world even further, even if you don't find out what you're supposed to do, you'll still probably find some nice Loot.</p>

<p class="final6">- If you feel like you've hit a Brick Wall in the progression of the game, make sure you level grind, it's better to be overleveled than it is to be underleveled.</p>
